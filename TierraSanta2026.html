                            <p>Enter the Basilica of the Nativity and descend to the Grotto of the Nativity, where a 14-pointed silver star marks the exact place where Jesus was born. There, silence and emotion speak louder than a thousand words.</p>
                            <p>We will visit the Shepherds' Field, where angels proclaimed the Good News on that holy night, and enter the Milk Grotto, where the Virgin Mary nursed the Christ Child. In St. Catherine's Church, we can join the liturgical chant that continues to rise day after day from this sacred land. Bethlehem is not just a destination: it is a return to the beginning of everything, to the God who became a child out of love.</p>

                            <p>Bethlehem, in the heart of Palestine, is the cradle of Christianity. Here, in a simple grotto, Jesus was born, the Son of God made man, fulfilling the prophecies that announced the Messiah born from David's lineage. This city has been a pilgrimage site since the 4th century, when St. Helena ordered a basilica to be built over the grotto of the nativity.</p>
                            <p>Throughout the centuries, Bethlehem has witnessed the devotion of kings, shepherds, saints, and millions of faithful who have come to prostrate themselves before the mystery of the Incarnation. Walking through its streets is returning to the origin of Christian faith, to the moment when heaven touched earth.</p>

                            <p>Walking through Nazareth is like entering the intimacy of Jesus' family life. Upon arriving at the Basilica of the Annunciation, you will feel the echo of Mary's "YES" that changed the history of the world. Under the dome, there is the inscription: "Here the Word became flesh," marking the place where heaven descended upon earth.</p>
                            <p>In St. Joseph's Workshop, contemplate the environment where the just carpenter educated the Messiah. Finally, drink from Mary's Well, symbol of the daily encounter with God in the ordinary. Every corner of Nazareth invites us to renew faith from simplicity, service, and trusting surrender.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="tab-pane" id="nazareth-history">
                            <p>Nazareth, in the region of Galilee, is much more than a picturesque village among hills: it is the place where the mystery of salvation began. Here, the angel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would be the Mother of the Savior, beginning the divine plan of redemption.</p>
                            <p>Although it was a humble and almost insignificant village in Jesus' time, it was chosen to become the home of the Holy Family. In its streets, Jesus lived his childhood and youth, worked with his hands alongside Joseph, and grew in obedience, wisdom, and grace before God and men.</p>

                            <p>Upon arriving at Capernaum, the silence of the stones will speak to you more than a thousand sermons. This small town, on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, witnessed multiple miracles and teachings of Jesus. Visit St. Peter's House, where the Lord healed his mother-in-law and where he frequently stayed during his ministry.</p>
                            <p>Walk through the remains of the ancient synagogue, built over the one where Jesus taught, and feel how the words of the Gospel still resonate among its white stone columns. Here occurred the miracle of the paralytic who was lowered through the roof to be placed before Jesus, where he not only healed his body but also his soul.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="tab-pane" id="capernaum-history">
                            <p>Capernaum, known as "Jesus' city," was the center of his public life in Galilee. On the shores of the Sea of Galilee, this ancient town witnessed miracles, teachings, and encounters that transformed lives. Here, Jesus healed the sick, cast out demons, called his first disciples, and spoke words of eternal life.</p>
                            <p>It was also the place where he lived after leaving Nazareth, and where he established a close relationship with Peter's family. The ruins that remain today reveal the importance of this city in the first century.</p>

                            <p>Since 1981, the small village of Medjugorje became one of the world's most visited Marian pilgrimage centers, following testimonies from six young people who claimed to have seen the Virgin Mary. Although the apparitions have not been officially approved by the Church, Rome has authorized organized pilgrimages.</p>
                            <p>Through messages centered on prayer, conversion, fasting, the Eucharist, and reconciliation, Medjugorje has established itself as a true school of spirituality for millions of faithful worldwide.</p>
