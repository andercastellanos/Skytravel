            <h2>What is a Catholic Pilgrimage to Medjugorje?</h2>
            <p>A <strong>Medjugorje pilgrimage</strong> is a Catholic journey to the Marian shrine in Bosnia and Herzegovina where the Virgin Mary first appeared on June 24, 1981 and continues to appear to Catholic visionaries. Unlike other Christian spiritual journeys, <strong>Medjugorje pilgrimages</strong> include essential sacramental elements of the Catholic faith: <strong>daily Mass</strong> celebrated by an accompanying Catholic priest, opportunity for the <strong>Sacrament of Confession</strong>, <strong>Eucharistic Adoration</strong>, praying the <strong>Holy Rosary</strong> at the sacred sites, and Catholic spiritual direction.</p>

            <p>Catholic pilgrims visit <strong>Apparition Hill (Podbrdo)</strong> where the first Marian apparition occurred, climb <strong>Cross Mountain (Krizevac)</strong> praying the Stations of the Cross, and participate at <strong>St. James Church</strong> in daily Masses and Catholic evening community prayer programs including the Rosary, testimonies and blessing with the Blessed Sacrament. This <strong>journey to Medjugorje</strong> offers a transformative experience of faith and spiritual renewal.</p>

            <h3>Why Make a Catholic Pilgrimage to Medjugorje?</h3>
            <ul class="reasons-list">
                <li><strong>Catholic spiritual renewal:</strong> Experience conversion of heart through Catholic sacraments (daily Mass and Confession)</li>

                <li><strong>Catholic faith community:</strong> Share the journey with Catholic pilgrims from around the world</li>
